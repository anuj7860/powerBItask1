Supervisor
The tables are linked together with a one-to-many relationship. State_list has a one-to-many relationship with Sales Data, meaning each state can have multiple sales records. Sales Data has a one-to-many relationship with Supervisor, meaning each sales record can be assigned to only one supervisor, but a supervisor can be assigned to multiple sales records.

This report appears to be designed to track sales data by state and by assigned supervisor. It can be used to answer questions such as:

What is the total sales volume for each state?
What is the sales performance of each supervisor?
What is the average cost of products in each category?
Without further context, it is difficult to create a full-fledged report based on this image. However, these are some potential insights that can be derived:

Sales Trends by State: The report can be used to analyze sales trends by state, such as identifying states with the highest sales volume or states with the most growth.
Supervisor Performance: The report can be used to track supervisor performance, such as identifying supervisors with the highest sales volume or supervisors with the highest customer satisfaction scores.
Product Analysis: The report can be used to analyze product sales data, such as identifying the most popular products or products with the highest profit margins.
