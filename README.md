This is a Power BI report with three tables: State_list, Sales Data, and Supervisor.

# sales dashboard
Data Tables:

State_list: This table holds information about different states, likely with fields like:
State: Full name of the state (e.g., California, Texas)
State_Code: Abbreviation or code (e.g., CA, TX)
Sales_Data: This table is likely the core data table. It seems to hold detailed sales information, potentially including fields like:
Assigned Supervisor: The person responsible for the sales.
Brand: The product or brand being sold.
Category: The category of the product.
Cost: Price of the item sold.
Customer_Name: The buyer's name.
Order_Date: The date of the sale.
Order_Number: A unique identifier for each sales transaction.
Product: The specific product sold.
Quantity: Number of items sold.
Supervisor: This table stores information about the sales supervisors, with fields like:
Image_URL: Link to a picture of the supervisor.
Supervisor: Name of the supervisor.

# Relationships:

State_list to Sales_Data: It seems there's a one-to-many relationship here, meaning one state can have multiple sales records associated with it. This suggests the sales data might be grouped by state.
Sales_Data to Supervisor: A one-to-one relationship exists, meaning each sales record is tied to a specific supervisor.
Insights:

Sales by State: The model allows analyzing sales data by state. You could use this to see which states have the highest sales, or how sales trends vary geographically.
Supervisor Performance: You can track the performance of individual supervisors by looking at their associated sales data.
Product Analysis: By grouping sales data by product, you can analyze product popularity, sales trends, and profitability.

# Report Recommendations:

State-wise Sales Report: A visual report showing sales figures (amount, quantity) for each state, perhaps a bar chart or map.
Supervisor Dashboard: A dashboard to visualize individual supervisor performance with metrics like total sales, average order value, and key performance indicators (KPIs).
Product Performance Analysis: A report to identify top-selling products, product categories, and sales trends.
Supervisor Performance: The report can be used to track supervisor performance, such as identifying supervisors with the highest sales volume or supervisors with the highest customer satisfaction scores.
Product Analysis: The report can be used to analyze product sales data, such as identifying the most popular products or products with the highest profit margins.
